# TCP Review

- [ ] Brief Review of Networking
- [ ] Networking - things we need to know
- [ ] Client Server
- [ ] Network Protocols:  TCP / UDP
- [ ] TCP Node programming
- [ ] Client & Server node apps
- [ ] How is any of this related to Web Development?
- [ ] Application protocols

### OSI model
 - Don't really need to know it.
 - Just be aware of it
 - Takeaway = separation of concerns

### Networking
Things we care about:
 - host address (or ip address)
 - protocol
 - port

### Client - Server
Like a Phone Call
- caller
- called
- Client Initiates the Interaction

### Protcols
- TCP:  connection based.  Most common for web dev
- UDP:  connectionless.  Common for communication

### TCP
- TCP is Connection based
- guaranteed delivery
- guaranteed order
- lets us know if something didn't get sebt

### Node.js Modules
- "net" Module - for TCP communications
- https://nodejs.org/api/net.html
- "dgram" Module - for UDP (less common for web dev)

### Application protocols:
- HTTP
- SMTP
- DNS
- SSH
